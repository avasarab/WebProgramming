    <h1> Hello! My name is Allison. I am so excited to be doing this, even though I second-guess myself a lot. I am hoping that with a lot of practice, I will be able to have confidence in myself and my knowledge.</h1>
    <p>So far I have learned the functions and definitions involved in HTML. I really like seeing the results, it is really fun. I liked seeing the words go from standard to bold or italic and then changing the size of an image when made viewable.</p>
    <p>I <strong>really</strong> like solving what seems like a riddle. Or even a puzzle. When doing the reading and the active learning activities- it made me get really ecited to be able to say I am messing around with coding. 
    <p>All while doing my school work, my cat Winnie was rubbing up on me for attention. She is a tortie cat, see the photo I have included of an exmaple of a tortie cat.</p>
